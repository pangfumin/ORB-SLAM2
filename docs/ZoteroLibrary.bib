	abstract = {This paper presents a method of estimating camera pose in an unknown scene. While this has previously been attempted by adapting SLAM algorithms developed for robotic exploration, we propose a system specifically designed to track a hand-held camera in a small AR workspace. We propose to split tracking and mapping into two separate tasks, processed in parallel threads on a dual-core computer: one thread deals with the task of robustly tracking erratic hand-held motion, while the other produces a 3D map of point features from previously observed video frames. This allows the use of computationally expensive batch optimisation techniques not usually associated with real-time operation: The result is a system that produces detailed maps with thousands of landmarks which can be tracked at frame-rate, with an accuracy and robustness rivalling that of state-of-the-art model-based systems.},

	abstract = {We propose a direct (feature-less) monocular SLAM algorithm which, in contrast to current state-of-the-art regarding direct methods, allows to build large-scale, consistent maps of the environment. Along with highly accurate pose estimation based on direct image alignment, the 3D environment is reconstructed in real-time as pose-graph of keyframes with associated semi-dense depth maps. These are obtained by filtering over a large number of pixelwise small-baseline stereo comparisons. The explicitly scale-drift aware formulation allows the approach to operate on challenging sequences including large variations in scene scale. Major enablers are two key novelties: (1) a novel direct tracking method which operates on sim(3){\textbackslash}mathfrak\{sim\}(3) , thereby explicitly detecting scale-drift, and (2) an elegant probabilistic solution to include the effect of noisy depth values into tracking. The resulting direct monocular SLAM system runs in real-time on a CPU.},

	abstract = {The gold standard method for tridimensional reconstruction and camera localization from a set of images is well known to be Bundle Adjustment (BA). Although BA was regarded for years as a costly method restricted to the offline domain, several real time algorithms based on BA flourished in the last decade. However those algorithms were limited to perform SLAM in small scenes or only Visual Odometry. In this work we built on excellent algorithms of the last years to design from scratch a Monocular SLAM system that operates in real time, in small and large, indoor and outdoor environments, with the capability of wide baseline loop closing and relocalization, and including full automatic initialization. Our survival of the fittest approach to select the points and keyframes of the reconstruction generates a compact and trackable map that only grows if the scene content changes, enhancing lifelong operation. We present an exhaustive evaluation in 27 sequences from the most popular datasets achieving unprecedented performance with a typical localization accuracy from 0.2\% to 1\% of the trajectory dimension in scenes from a desk to several city blocks. We make public a ROS implementation.},

Especially for the second task laser scanners are the sensor of choice as they provide precise range measurements. This work proposes an approach for simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) specifically designed for the Velodyne HDL-64E laser scanner which exhibits characteristics not present in most other systems. This comprises the continuous, spinning data acquisition and the relative high sensor noise. Together, these make standard SLAM approaches generate noisy maps and inaccurate trajectories. We show that it is possible to generate precise maps and localize therein in spite of not using wheel speed sensors or other information. The presented approach is evaluated on a novel, challenging 3D data set being made publicly available.},

For points and lines located in the same plane, the correspondence between the two cameras is a collineation. We show that the unknowns (the camera motion and the plane equation) can be recovered, in general, from an estimate of the matrix of this collineation. The two-fold ambiguity that remains can be removed by looking at a second plane, by taking a third view of the same plane, or by using a priori knowledge about the geometry of the plane being looked at. We then show how to combine the estimation of the matrix of collineation and the obtaining of point and line matches between the two images, by a strategy of Hypothesis Prediction and Testing guided by a Kalman filter. We finally show how our approach can be used to calibrate a system of cameras.},

Most scan match algorithms require finding correspondences between the used features, i.e. points or lines. We propose an alternative representation for a range scan, the normal distributions transform. Similar to an occupancy grid, we subdivide the 2D plane into cells. To each cell, we assign a normal distribution, which locally models the probability of measuring a point. The result of the transform is a piecewise continuous and differentiable probability density, that can be used to match another scan using Newton's algorithm. Thereby, no explicit correspondences have to be established. We present the algorithm in detail and show the application to relative position tracking and simultaneous localization and map building (SLAM). First results on real data demonstrate, that the algorithm is capable to map unmodified indoor environments reliable and in real time, even without using odometry data.},
